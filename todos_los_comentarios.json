Anyway, we KNOW that Trump would never concede so it will go to the bitter end.  \n\nI am guardedly hopeful that the American people will do the right thing.

We are married now.\n\nIf you had a lot of dating experience, I’d say forget this guy. But when you’re new to dating, the point of dating is to see what you like, and, just as importantly, see what you don’t like. You’re gathering data on yourself. Even if it’s a boring date where you don’t connect, you’re learning how you can stand up for yourself, and leave. That’s a great skill to have.\n\nSuggest a daytime meeting spot and see what he says.

It was not marked and i had instructed her to treat it as a 4-way but she did not.\n\nThe person we cut off then turns in behind us as we left the lot and entered the main road.  We have not one but TWO large yellow \"student driver\" signs on the car and she had to have seen them.  She then pulls into the next lane over and i know what is going to happen next, so I tell my daughter to immediately slow down and pull over into the shoulder area.\n\nSure enough, the woman (perhaps around 30) pulls up in front of us and brake-checks us???\n\nGiven we were already on the brakes and changing lanes she wasted her time and energy doing this, it accomplished absolutely nothing.\n\nIt was an important defensive driving for my daughter..  some people are so petty that mistaking a 4-way and taking someone else' turn means they will now brake-check and potentially cause an accident to \"teach you a lesson\"?  given the large student driver signs it was obviously an inexperienced driver making a minor mistake??",

        "comentario": "When I was growing up, we went to great lengths to make sure my parents never interacted with my friends' parents or knew who anyone was. Being Gen X latchkey kids of immigrants this wasn't very hard since my parents barely knew who I was, much less the people I was hanging out with.\n\nWe have two grown sons who are a decade apart. With the older one we would only very tangentially touch base with the other parents during drop offs or pickups; this is in the early 2000s so the world was less connected then. He had a small circle of friends and all of *their* parents were also anti-social, so it all worked out. We generally hosted or shepherded the kids, and the other parents always had our contact information but rarely used it.\n\nWith the younger, we've been involved in his extracurriculars as volunteers so became quite good friends with all the other parents (at least those that volunteered. These are, not coincidentally, also the kind of people who are awesome to be around); last Christmas we took 10 of the kids on a two week graduation trip to Japan (kids largely paid their own way). The other parents were totally cool with us taking their kids to another fucking country because we all knew each other and are friends. The younger one has a much larger circle of friends and we're familiar with most of them.\n\nLooking at how our lives have turned out, I think there's huge benefits from being involved and having a multi-generational community. I've had some of the other kids call me to diagnose car trouble over the phone, or mentor them on financial planning.\n\nTo answer your questions: it's probably \"unreasonable\" to demand it once the kids are mobile and independent -- e.g., 16ish and driving around on their own. You should definitely ask for emergency contact information, but no need to make things \"weird\" if that's not the environment.\n\nYounger than that -- definitely at the 13-14 year range. For love interests it's always a bit tricky. Chances are at this age it's just \"hanging out with feelings\" -- and if you meet the other parents and really hit it off with them and then the kids have a falling out and hate each other because they're roiling bundles of hormones and unstable balls of emotion -- it's just sad. But it's still nice to meet them to get a gage of the kid's SO's background at some point. We met our younger son's SO's parents through the volunteering before the kids got to know each other, I think, and we're quite close (we have dinner nearly every week). So hopefully the kids work out!\n\nI don't have daughters but I suspect parents tend to be more protective because generally girls get preyed on more (not to say boys aren't -- I was SAed growing up so it's not like boys are immune, but I don't think we can pretend girls aren't more vulnerable).",

She wasn't a considerate roommate anymore: any request for change or to do the chores was met with anger, she didn't help keep the apartment clean anymore, and she generally drank more and created more messes.\n\nMy wife Jane left Sarah behind after college, but when Jane was getting married to me, she asked Sarah to be a bridesmaid. They weren't living close to each other, so Jane didn't ask for much; just to get a dress in a particular color. (And be reimbursed by Jane.) Sarah decided to send a \"joke\" email about not liking the color and buying a completely different color, bringing Jane to tears. Jokes do *not* work well over email.",

        "comentario": "I think some of these types of stories are perspective. Like as a child for eg you think someone is great till you grow up and learn more about them and know better. I think an over arcing experience for many people is meeting others who have ulterior motives. Like friends who turn out to be bad for you or snakes. People who you thought liked you but turned around for seemingly no reason other than judgement, cast you out. I've had experiences like that but here's my thing. Normal people don't have enemies etc. No villains. Real life isn't a tv show. Everyone is human. So to humanize people in a way that keeps them accountable I stick to saying \"they just dont like me and act on it\" or \"hes done so much bad stuff to you its like darkness for you every time you go back to him\" latter i've said to a friend. \n\n  \nI feel that framing things as villians and heroes is based in extremely basic understanding of human nature and ego thinking. If you view it with dimension, the bad people are doing bad things and by virtue of that you protect yourself by either fighting against their actions or staying away from them. But those people are still like, going to the store and thanking the clerks and cashiers when they buy their groceries. The reality is that monsters love to smile and be nice, because they can. They're people. And really lovely people who will be loyal to you till they die will sometimes have really bad times. Its super hard for a lot of folks to tell that apart. So all we have are experiences and snap shots. I have the version of a person I don't like in my head, then she dates my friend and I have to sit by while he experiences his version of her. \n\nThis is why things like principles that guide you matter. Helping people and trying to live like a good person. Learning about the world beyond what you think you understand of it etc. A lot of my approach will always boil down to tao principles, it simply is, at it is, and as it always was. Everything just exists.",

The kind of person who has people buzzing around them at all times, but she always maintained a kind and gracious demeanor and never let it get to her head.\n\nShe started dating this guy \"Steve\" when they were both about 30. His personality was completely different than anyone she had ever hung out with. He was always friendly and seemed genuine, but he was the kind of macho and loud guy she had always previously shied away from. Her personality completely changed when she met Steve. Not necessarily in a terrible way, but she adopted most of his traits, which was weird. Usually, people who morph into someone else when they enter a new relationship lack confidence or experience, but that was not Kate at all.\n\nFast forward 6 months, and Steve dies in a very odd car accident. He was hit by another car (it was Steve's fault, but he wasn't drunk or being reckless) in a very industrial part of town late at night. It wasn't a seedy area, but there would be no reason for anyone but a night shift worker at an industrial plant to be in that area. It also wasn't near where he or his friends lived. Even if he was having an affair, it wasn't an area he'd drive through to get to any residential or nightlife neighborhoods. It also wasn't an area known for drugs or prostitution. There was just no possible explanation for why he'd be there at 11:30 on a weeknight.\n\nAnyway, Kate goes off the deep end and marries one of Steve's best friends, Bill, less than a year later. Bill is an awful dude, and Kate morphs into an awful woman as soon as she starts dating him. I know people do that, but Kate had always been so confident and firm in her beliefs - she wasn't the kind of person who typically does that.\n\nSo yeah, Kate went from being one of the best people I knew to one of the worst.",

I learned too late in life that just because you share blood, doesn't mean you are obligated to continue to have a relationship with them. I was lucky enough to have a very patient and wonderful wife, and canceled my mother about 4-5 years ago. Only regret that I waited so long. Make your life about you, you do not get a second chance.

As a kid, the night it aired in 1978, i was sent to bed early as a punishment for hitting my little brother. I cried and pleaded to no avail. “please Ma, i’m sorry! You don’t understand! It’s Star Wars!” Nope. Off to bed i went, cried myself to sleep. The next morning i asked my brother “So what was it like?” The special he described to me was sounded like it was the greatest thing ever put on television. He said Darth Vader and Luke had a lightsaber duel, Chewbacca was swinging from a vine and took out four Stirmtroopers, Han Solo was picking off Sand People left and right, Leia was throwing jawas off a cliff, there was a massive space battle, a Dewback and a Bantha started fighting, C3-PO and R2-D2 were fighting a Death Star Droid and R5-D5, and he mentioned the Boba Fett cartoon (who none of us knew who he was at the time). Anyway, i was so crestfallen to have missed this epic. Years go by, i finally get a copy, i ran home with my treasure, shaking with excitement, fumbling to get the tape out of it’s clamshell case. Put it in. Watched it. it was the worst piece of shit thing that i have ever seen! I called my brother. “You asshole! You lied to me! How could you do that!” He said “you shouldn’t have hit me, paybacks a bitch!” ",

There’s a myriad of reasons, but many are empty nesters with kids that are too busy to keep in touch, have lost spouses, death of friends, physical illness that restricts mobility, etc. \n\nIsolation and loneliness in older adults raises the risk of dementia by nearly 30%. This rises significantly if the person is or becomes hard of hearing. \n\nIt also increases the risk of heart disease, frequent ER visits, hospital stays, clinical depression and anxiety, inflammation-related illnesses, diabetes, suicide, and premature death in general. \n\nFriends, even just acquaintances that you speak with on a regular basis in your immediate neighborhood, create communities, and communities create resilience. Resilience is the difference between weathering possible catastrophic losses, illness, etc…or crumbling. \n\nOur brains are wired in complex ways so that we can communicate with others.

One has died and to this day, the other has zero support system outside of the aunts and myself and siblings. Unsurprisingly and unintentionally, my parents inappropriately relied on us children for emotional support and by extension, a lot of our emotional needs went unmet as children. \n\nSo, the combination of a history of not having a model of parents with healthy and varied adult friendships and not having experience with healthy emotional boundaries, has resulted in every single one of us now adult children, having little to no adult friendships outside of the family. \n\nAs a parent myself, I've decided to break that cycle. It's important to me to model having a life outside of being a parent for my children, having a variety of safe adults around the children that they'll be able to rely on/interact with/who'll look out for them, and to build a support network outside of my romantic relationships. \n\nSo I've invested in friends who won't take it personally if I take days or a week to respond or dont usually initiate convos, who have varied interests, who are open to spending time even when I'm in parent mode, and who understand that I need a little extra motivation to get my ass up out of the house sometimes when they invite me out and I'm not in the mood. So yes, even when I feel like I'm cool being alone and being a bum, I make the effort to respond to their message or accept an invitation. Just like I will make the effort even when I don't feel like it with a romantic partner, because I'm old enough to understand that relationships need to be maintained and require effort even when you just don't feel like it.\n\nNot once have I regretted putting effort into building these kinds of friendships.",

I have very limited time for socialization as sports take up a lot of weekends, and non-sports weekends are usually filled with projects and things that need to be accomplished around the house. \n\nI miss my old friends.  Post Covid, I make sure i see them 3-4 times a year.  It’s not much, but it’s something. They understand I’ve moved and am busy, we joke that things will get better in 5-6 years.    I ask them to keep inviting me to events like Halloween parties and summer BBQs even though we all know the likelihood of me making it are relatively low.   We do keep in touch on social media, and I have group chats with a couple of different sets of friends where we send memes and talk about whatever bullshit we talk about in person.  It’s less than ideal, but I’m *extremely* grateful.   I chat with my best friend over text nearly every day.  He moved 250 miles away before I moved 30 miles away, so we are lucky to see each other once a year given our full schedules and distance.     \n\nI have new friends where I live now.  95% are friends in my neighborhood, it’s a small and tight knit community.  I genuinely like some of these people and I truly consider them friends.  However, there is a bit of a “friend by proximity” thing going as if someone moved even 10 minute away, I’m not sure how often we’d stay in touch.  It’s already difficult to keep in contact when we all tend to be hermits in the winter months. \n\nYou sound happy and content.  I do wonder if you’re on a difficult trajectory once you and your spouse become empty nesters.   It doesn’t sound like there’s a large investment in your relationship.  Being an introvert with an extroverted spouse is fine, but you have to share more than a sex life and time together with your children.",

Former friends who just can't be bothered to put in any effort.  Make no mistake, if your former friends ever actually valued your friendship, they're probably hurt by your lack of any care or effort.  I know I've been hurt by people who I care about who end up deciding that they just lack the energy or will to be social anymore.  Your post seems to be about YOU want... whether YOU want to send a message or what not.  You don't seem to be thinking about what others feel.  Friendships are supposed to be reciprocal, not just whether your life feels 'balanced' or not.\n\nMy kids are older and are around the age of moving out, having their own friends and relationships, etc., and as I move past the 'mom all the time' stage, I am SO thankful for the friendships that have stayed strong over the years.  There aren't a ton of them at this point, but they are worth their weight in gold.  They're not just there to balance out my life... we've been through some times together (one is a cancer survivor, one has a complicated family situation where I've tried to offer support over the years.)  They've supported me through things too.  I one hundred percent love and value them and put in the effort to keep the friendships current.",

I’m planning on putting a note under their door about starting a book group, which we’d discussed during the party. \n\nHere’s what I’ve learned, which has been true in most aspects of life. It is easier to do things alone. No need to negotiate, resolve conflict, etc. However, it’s more rewarding to do things with others, and the caliber of work/fun you can achieve is higher. I say this as the oldest immigrant child who was parentified and isolated most of my childhood.\n\n Online interaction is both easier and inferior, which makes it especially unfortunate for developing connections.

We’ve traveled as a group a few times, which was a blast.\n\nAs a single person, I rely heavily on these friendships for my social support. I am an introvert and tend to forget to initiate calls or hang-outs, but I love musicals and regularly organize group outings to see them. When a friend initiates a different culture activity I try to say yes.\n\nDuring COVID we set up a group Zoom call every week at the same time. Whoever is free joins. Sometimes it feels like work, but other times it’s fun and having it keeps us all connected. We also have multiple group chats going now—one general with all of us and others interested-based.\n\nETA: I think it’s totally OK to contact folks you haven’t stayed in touch with.

At least we talked about something other than marital problems or money. But most of male friendships ended because of a lack of empathy and too much emotional selfishness. I was supposed to be the ear that got bent but that was never reciprocated; i.e. they were just looking for an audience for their one-man show.

I just like getting stuff done that makes me happy. I think its neat and fun!\n\nAs for the message to your friends, I would say that's more of a social media thing than a direct message/text. Maybe a post that about \"leading a quieter life\".",

        "comentario": "Your situation sounds a lot like what I’ve felt at times, and honestly, it’s okay to be in that space. Friendships in your 40s can be really different than in your younger years, and often they’re less about frequency and more about depth when they do occur. Like, when I was younger, it was all about quantity—friends everywhere, all the time. But now, it’s the quality that counts.\n\nI totally get the contentment with just chillin’ with your own company. It doesn’t mean you’re any less social, it's just about recharging in a different way. You know, I sometimes think about picking up the phone to catch up with an old buddy but then quickly decide that peace and quiet are kinda nice, too. There's something pretty great about being comfortable with your own vibe.\n\nAs for letting folks know where you stand, it's not a bad idea if you think they might be wondering. You could send that note if it feels right to you. It’d probably be a relief to hear that you’re good and there are no hard feelings. But if you’re just overthinking it (which I’ve definitely done before), you could just let it be and see if anything changes naturally over time.\n\nEveryone’s got their own little groove, and it sounds like you’ve found yours. Nothing says adult friendships have to look a certain way. Some people are social butterflies forever, and some of us become content homebodies. Just do what keeps you happy and sane, you know? Keep nourishing what works; the rest will take care of itself, I think.",

I mean they do cool things, and travel and have hobbies–but personality-wise... it's very transient feeling.\n\nI was making $88k 10 years ago and was paycheck to paycheck. I also think of it as half a city. Baltimore is the other half. Which, well... I can't even start. Annapolis is nice. And everything inbetween is what Id heard called \"bedroom communities\".\n\nI also remember looking at a place in Silver Spring, right on the line. Literally the metro passed the apartment, and it was really nice, around $2300 at the time. And on the way back to the office after checking it out saw chicken wing bones laying on the steps.\n\nI looked at places in Arlington and Clarendon, around there... that was around $2000-$2500 10 years ago. And the places I looked at, some of them just looked right out at a building across the street.\n\nAlso the \"Orange Crush\" is famous for coming in from the west side into Downtown.\n\nFancy food, and counter only—very few in the middle. I'd gone to a Vietnamese pho place by the Zoo—$26 for a small bowl and spring rolls. That was 10 years ago as well moneywise.\n\nAll the museums, the Mall, the White House—you can see that stuff in 2-3 days and that's about it. There's a few more quirky museums too, but in general—artswise, I hate to say it, but it sucks. I mean the traditional stuff—hard to get any better but anything that a city does arts-wise, Baltimore is where to go for that.\n\nI was near Chevy Chase, was $1900 rent, 1 mile from Van Ness or Chevy Chase metro and if I took it to work near the White House, it was 45m, $11, and about a collective walk of 2 miles a day. If I used the bus instead of walk, $11, 1-1.25h commute, .5 miles a day. Driving was 15m, $11.\n\nYou pay for convenience.\n\nI did get to see AF1 a lot, Marine One and its decoys. And the week prior to voting for Obama's second term, he was all over doing fundraisers. He had lunch in my building, and a few days later was speaking at an event inside a hotel on my walk home. I waited it out with 20 or so others on the streetcorners. They fired up the motorcycles and lights on the motorcade which was 100% fucking cool. And then they grouped us onto one corner instead of 4, and was thinking to myself \"it's my right to stand on any corner...\" thinking it was for safety (partially could have been), but was still excited so forgot that feeling—and sure as hell, the motorcade started moving and they went in a procession swerving right over to our corner and sure enough a big ol' smile and a waving hand of President Obama was in the back of \"The Beast\" waving at us maybe 10-15' from us. \n\nChicago is a real city and people from where I am move there because it's a fun, real city with a vibrant social scene. And I mean that, like recent grad-type. I don't know it well, but it has a lot of business opportunities. The cold may make you want to move too, but even if it's for a while, go for it. \n\nNC is really a nice area too, and bustling. And still East Coast. Also NW Philly seems to have a lot of NYC runover and has a lot of opportunities there too.\n\nDC is more support and PR to whomever is in office. Lots of lawyers, thinktanks, academics. I met some very posh, educated people and what I did at the time, I humbly destroyed them with what I do. Some of the worst people doing what I did, but mostly because in that industry you have to not be afraid and let yourself look dumb sometimes. \n\nGood luck! Have fun, but whatever you do, I'd stay away from DC. It's very insular and insulated.",

Her and her husband ended up living in some suburb of Virginia.  \n\nGoing back to Chicago, we have lots of pro sports, a great restaurant scene, and lots of events all the time.\n\nMy bet is you would probably have a better social life in Chicago because as I understand it, a lot of DC stuff revolves around politics and government and if that’s not something you’re into I’m not sure you would want to live there. But the good thing about Chicago is that there’s a little bit of everybody.",

We burned through a bunch of retirement savings to get the appropriate help for our girl, and insurance didn't pay for anything other than regular doctor visits or illness.\n\nSo we moved to Washington- one of the very few states that required insurance to pay for autism treatments. I was fortunate to find a job there, and having coverage was a game changer. We were in an incredibly small minority, getting a chance to change our circumstances at that level, and being able to afford the move.\n\nA couple of years later, the ACA became law. Families don't face this challenge anymore, since insurance companies are required to provide autism coverage nationwide.\n\nThis is the big personal improvement in our lives, thanks to the ACA.

You get into an accident and your car is a wreck, so, the next day, you buy a $150/mo insurance policy and turn in a claim for the \"preexisting condition.\" They replace your car for $30,000 and you cancel the policy a month later, having paid then $300. Multiply that by 330ml Americans. In fact, why would anyone carry any insurance at all until after the accident? \n\nObviously, that's not how car insurance works.\n\nSo, imagine this scenario instead: You get by with little or no health insurance. You get cancer and it's going to costs hundreds of thousands to treat it. You run out and buy a good insurance policy, pay that new insurance company $5,000 and they get to pay $200,000 to try to save your life. Multiply that by the number of people who get diagnosed with cancer every year. See how that doesn't wory out on the balance sheet?\n\nMy point is not that preexisting conditions should not be covered. I think that they should. My point is that financially speaking, there are problems with the current setup and insurance companies are no longer able to assess risk and underwrite very effectively. Health insurance in the US is more like a maintenance contract than an insurance policy, but worse. The problems with healthcare in the US are complex. The Republicans are wrong if they think repealing PPACA/Obamacare is going to fix them, but this issue is not as simple as \"insurance should cover everything!\" because that is also economically unsustainable. \n\nApologies for the nuanced approach to the matter.

People like or hate me for being myself and my husband envies that. lol. \n\nThat it’s unbecoming and condescending to complain about how busy you are, because we all have the same number of hours a day and we are each the master of our own schedules. If you seek sympathy because you enjoy playing a martyr and acting like nothing would get done without you, that’s on you and your poor boundaries and emotional neediness. \n\nThat you will never regret saving for retirement.\n\nThat when someone shows you who they are, believe them. So if they cancel, don’t ever make plans with them unless it’s with a group. If they are always short on money, drop them at the plasma donation center before you go somewhere. \n\nThat you need to be a friend to have friends. \n\nThat we need to be mindful that our judgements of others are based on their worst result while we judge ourselves on our best intentions and we have to clap back at that habit and give people the benefit of of the doubt and hold ourselves more accountable to have more fulfilling relationships. \n\nThat you need to ask questions and listen and act interested when other people talk for people to enjoy your company. \n\nIt’s always good to give people the benefit of the doubt and check yourself when your mind jumps to conclusions or assumes Ill-intent or character flaws. \n\nNot to complain about your recent health scare or move before you’ve asked the listener about theirs. So many times people vent to me about moving to this new place and they’ve actually been here months longer than I have and I’m the one who needs the help from them.  I’ve also seen people complain about a health problem or a parent…unwittingly, to someone who is undergoing intense cancer treatment or just lost their parent.\n\nUse Reverse psychology with your kids and passive-aggressive people. It works. \n\nLet your kids be in charge. Let them help plan and prepare and clean up. Be a scaffold of support, and stop running to do things before they get started. Let them do it their way and decided for themselves whether they would do it that way again. \n\nThat Grief is a part of life because nobody lives forever. And grief is a marathon, not a sprint and it’s something to allow not run away from. \n\nThat People are Failures at Self-reporting. For example, almost everyone who drinks says they drink a couple times a week, but most actually drink more. I took a tally when I was dating people. \n\nThat if you don’t want in-laws, don’t get married. In-laws are an inherently difficult relationship. Even that random person who professes to get along amazingly with their in-laws…I’ve never seen the proof! I’ve seen many of them eat their words when the in-laws come to visit for a few days! \n\nThat it’s rude to come to a dinner party empty handed and/or early. If you host, you get it. \n\nThat you don’t mix money and family/friends. If you want to gift them a bit of cash, go ahead, but don’t pay attention to how they manage their money afterwards or you will be sad panda. Lots of people can’t let money pile up, even after they get a tax return or a bonus or an extra payday. That’s not for you to feel bad for them.",

Trader Joe’s also has an eggplant pepper spread that is just delicious on a sandwich.  And a sprinkle of salt on your sandwiches makes it feel elevated.

The caretakers took over $2M from him before I was able to get guardianship and cut off the spigot and sue and file criminal charges against the caretakers.\n\nWhat is happening here is the CNA has probably already bled Grandma dry of the liquid funds she had, and is now getting her to do the reverse mortgage to keep the gravy train of financial theft and exploitation going.\n\nAs others have said, this is an urgent matter of the highest order. This scumbag will bleed Grandma dry for everything if your MIL doesn't step in IMMEDIATELY. If the POA is not sufficient to stop it then she may need to get an estate attorney to file for immediate emergency temporary guardianship to stop the financial bleeding. That's what I had to do.\n\nAnd then she'll need to do a full financial accounting of what monies this CNA has received since being the caretaker. I suspect once she sees the financial records, a lawsuit and a call to the police to file criminal charges will be in order. Also things I had to do. \n\nSadly, elder financial abuse and exploitation is absolutely epidemic and too many \"caretakers\" get away with it. Don't let it happen here.",

For example healthcare, financial, etc. If GMA has been deemed unfit to make her own financial decisions, then legally the documents would be null and void. Essentially the same as your kid signing documents selling the house. \n\nMy experience is with healthcare POAs, which are put in place while the patient is still able to make their own decisions. Once they are unable to make their own decisions it is signed by 2 providers and activated allowing the POA to make decisions on their behalf. They are no longer deemed able to make their own decisions in their healthcare. \n\nIs the CNA through an agency?  You need to contact the agency asap and let them know this is happening. If they are through a home health agency, call and tell them you need to speak to the Administrator. That is basically the person in charge of the agency. She likely isn’t the only person the CNA has done this to. \n\nIf they are an actual CNA and not just an aide or carer they are licensed in many states. Reach out to the licensing board and file a complaint against them. Often the department of professional services, department of licensing, or something similar.",

She is doing what it takes to buy her some more time. Reverse mortgages typically go to 150% of the value of the home. Coupled with Social Security it could possibly buy her several more years at home.\n\nWhat bothers me here is, why is everyone going \"Waaaahhh Grandma won't go into the home we picked for her!?\" \n\nGrandma clearly wants to stay in her home. Why isn't the family working together to make that happen? Its not shady for a church friend to try to help Grandma do what she wants to do. This may not be about the nurse making money at all. Maybe..just maybe...all these people feel badly for Grandma, with her family trying to push her out of her house.\n\nI am in my 50's, but I already have a plan for if I am ever in this situation. My attorney will be handling my estate, not my family. And anyone that tries to push me into a nursing home, as long as I'm still mentally competent, will be immediately disinherited. Sorry, I'm on Grandma's side here. If the reverse mortgage won't get her enough to hire in home help more than a year, it won't fund a 'nice' nursing home for more than a year either.",

We’ve been working for years to create new traditions so that is a family we carry on after her passing.\n\nThat’s all background and doesn’t really address your question , I think the truest answer is you need to look within your heart and find what brings you joy regarding holidays. What happy memories do you have from the past that you want to continue, what things make you so unbearably sad that you want to avoid them, and how can you best honor everything your father worked to create for you.\n\nI guess what I’m saying is there are no easy answers. There is no universal solution. I will make the assumption that you’re strong enough to be able to move forward\n\nOne last thought if I may, you’re very fortunate to have a father whom you love and miss . That in itself is a blessing.\n\nI hope you do well. Keep in mind the sadness you feel is just a reflection of the happiness you experience with your dad.",

You had a tragedy at a terrible developmental stage and it's fair that you're reacting. I lost my dad a few years ago when I was an adult and it was hard AF. I'm sorry you had to go through that at such a young age. \n\nDial in on the stuff you do enjoy. If you like Die Hard and chocolate covered cherries, plan yourself a binge in mid December. If you liked those cheesy crock pot potatoes and the Eminem Jingle Bells song, have at it. \n\nTry an advent calendar for something you like - you can get ones full of coffee or liquor chocolates or Harry Potter socks or D&amp;D dice. Just one little smile on your face in the morning can help your day get off to a merrier start. \n\nSome people like to volunteer around the holidays. I do a low income Secret Santa program for seniors so I can buy the presents I would have given my dad to someone who is struggling and make them happy. \n\nI get very depressed around the holidays. So I have a relative come visit at the end of November and we spend a week getting stoned and she helps me put up my tree and decorate because twinkly lights help me feel more festive. I find \"fake it 'till you make it\" works better than sitting in my wooly pj's and waiting for the Christmas magic to find me. \n\nI also take a deep dive into holiday baking shows - somehow watching a grown man weep because his Rudolph cake fell apart makes me feel Christmassy. Then I get a bit inspired and start to bake. Then the house smells good, and I'm well fed, and I feel better. \n\nI like giving gifts, so I spend months shopping and weeks hunting through the house to see where the hell I put everything. This year I'm giving a friend and his kids the vintage millenium falcon neither of us got when we were kids, and I'm excited about that. Shopping early also gives you the opportunity to eat all the luxury candy you bought to give away, then forces you to go out into the Christmas carolly world.",

Either nostalgia or a want to have some new traditions drove me to seeking out ways to rekindle some of that old holiday spirit.

Then in one of my screwy dreams he was there telling me we loved Christmas, it was our favorite time, and the year before I got a pass but I needed to get the decorations out and do Christmas again. I dragged everything out of the storage room, found that the tree wasn’t going to get through another year, and went from there. \n\nI picked a tree he would have hated covered in flocking, we decorated it in jewel tones which he would have hated, and did a few fun things. My younger daughter came over with her fiancé and pointed out how dad would have hated all of it. I told her he died and left me so he doesn’t get a vote. \n\nHe also loved Halloween. For the first time I sat with the candy bowl without him, and actually had a good time passing out candy to the kids who came by.",

But now, when I see how much these things mean to her children and grandchildren, it fills me with gratitude and I'm so proud of being able to pass the joy along to the next generation.\n\nIf this sort of thing isn't your scene, or if you're not sure how to replicate what your dad did to make family times special, I think the next best option is to look for ways to volunteer in your community.\n\nBeing there to help someone who may really be struggling during a time of year when everyone around them seems to be so happy is enormously fulfilling. Holiday spirit is about gratitude for all that we've been given, and I guarantee you there are people around you who have been given far less than you have.\n\nCreating joy and comfort for someone else tends to have a wonderful ricochet effect :)",

When she died, holidays never felt the same after that. Then a few years after her passing, I got pregnant, now I have my own kid (a toddler now) but instead of feeling like the “magic” of the holidays is renewed, I just feel way more pressure to make it special for my kid, I feel pressure to make the holidays nice and memorable for her, I feel pressure from others to spend money on tons of gifts (I absolutely HATE the consumerism aspect of it all) and I also feel way more annoyed and burdened in general around the holidays because now there’s family constantly pressuring us to drive our kid around everywhere to go visit them on the holidays, so It’s not nearly as enjoyable or acceptable to just be a hermit/loner at the holidays anymore. \n\nI have thought about just going away for the holidays with my husband and daughter so I don’t have to deal with the whole thing, but my husband is extremely family oriented and I know I would also feel like I was depriving my kid of family time at the holidays. ",
